# Algorithmic Design and Techniques


`algos/` holds the code for the solutions to programming challenges of [UC San DiegoX: ALGS200x](https://www.edx.org/es/course/algorithmic-design-techniques-uc-san-diegox-algs200x)

`tests/` hold the test for each challenge.


Most of them work, though some of them (`pairs.py` comes to mind) might some half-assed refactor/optimization attempts.

Some of them have helpful comments about the different ways to think about the algorithms.

This class was great, though variable in terms of instructor quality, sorry Pavel Pevzner! In general, this problem-centric approach worked well for pushing me through the struggles I've had before with more proof-oriented, analysis heavy algorithm courses like Roughgarden's.

I have two or three posts I'm going put among [my things](http://puhrez.com/things/), mostly regarding ways of thinking about algorithm design paradigms which are rather implicit in their construction, but were like epiphanies to me when it can to solving the challenges.
